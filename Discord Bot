I was immediately struck by her intelligence and her passion for the subject matter. As a professor at Harvard, I had seen many students come and go, but there was something different about her.

We began working together on her thesis, spending countless hours in my office, discussing theories and analyzing data. I was her mentor, her teacher, her confidant. Over time, our conversations became more personal. We talked about our families, our dreams, and our fears. I found myself looking forward to our meetings, eager to hear her thoughts and insights.

It wasn't long before I realized that I had developed feelings for her. I tried to push them aside, to focus on our work, but it was impossible. She was too beautiful, too talented, too captivating. And so, one day, I finally confessed my love for her.

To my surprise, she felt the same way. We began a secret relationship, sneaking around campus and stealing moments whenever we could. I knew it was wrong, that it could jeopardize both of our careers, but I couldn't resist her.

I felt alive in a way I hadn't in years. But the reality of our situation began to weigh on me. I was a professor, she was a student. I was in my 60s, she was in her 20s. It was never going to work.

One day, I had to end it. I couldn't keep living a lie, couldn't keep risking everything for a relationship that was doomed from the start. I sat her down in my office and told her that we had to break up. She cried, begged me to reconsider, but I knew it was the right thing to do.

After that, everything changed. Our conversations became stilted, awkward. She avoided me in the hallways, in class, on campus. I felt like a pariah, a man who had committed a great sin. I tried to move on, to focus on my work, but the memory of her haunted me.

Years have passed since then, and I've found some measure of peace. I still think of her, of what could have been, but I know that it was never meant to be. I hope she's happy, that she's found someone who can give her the love and happiness she deserves. As for me, I'll always carry the memory of her with me, a bittersweet reminder of a love that was never meant to be.
